<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
  must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your
  information is true.

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <p>
   - In the graph we can see a decrease, since in the first
     month ( December) the energy expenditure was 142, and in
     the last month (April) the expenditure was 126 , this is 
     also known as a negative linear correlation.
  </p>
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <p>
    - The relationship of the dots and their colors mainly indicates
      that they are different variables , in the graph we can see that
      they are not correlated since the red dots are very scattered from 
      the greys</p>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
    syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
    $$ y= (-270)(6)+(141.50)= -1478.5 $$
  <p>
   R= It is estimated that next month -147.5 Kwhs will be consumed
  </p>
    
    <li>
      A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or
      remain stable the consumption of electric energy.
      <p>
       -In conclusion, we can said that the relation between points is negative
        this means that every month the energy is decreasing , this happens except
        in month 1 and month 4 in which the energy indices are increased to 141 and
        142 kwhs , it is also evidenced that it has a model of heteroscedasticity since
        it is not equal the regression line and the real consumption , so the energy 
        consumption is not ideal except in month 2 with 136 khws of consumption , and in
        month 3 with a notable decrease , the rest of the months are managed to get quite
        close to the regression line ; however to maintain these stable indices must replicate
        the actions in month 2 for example , not leave the TV or the lights on, this is the main
        factor since it is not passed

    </li>
  </p>
</ul>

<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis2Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis2Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <p>
    This graph shows an increase since it starts with 2 residents consuming
    69kWhs of energy and ends with 8 residents consuming 728kWhs of energy, this
    is also known as positive correlation
  </p>
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <p>
    It can be evidenced 2 colors, the red dots can be seen with
   the actual consumption of residents in which the dots are not
    well located as it is far from linear regression
  </p>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
    people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
</li>
$$ y= (107.69)(200)+(-211.55)= 21326.45 $$
<p>
  R=  Energy consumption in a residence where 200 people live is21326.45 Kwhs 
</p>
  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
    between these two variables.
  </li>
  <P>
    It can be evidenced an increase and growth in terms of regression,
    because according to the number of residents can decrease or increase 
    energy consumption ,starting with the fewer residents who are (2) to the
    maximum of these(8) and the impact it has on energy expenditure, you can see
    that many of the data are repeated due to the independent variable so the
    data looks very repetitive , and yet they do not have a correlation with the 
    regression line
  </P>

    
</ul>
