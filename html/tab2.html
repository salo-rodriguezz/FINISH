<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
  must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your
  information is true.
</p>
<div id="analysis1Plot1"></div>
<p id="analysis1Eqn1" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <p>
      I can observe that in the graph the regression line begins
      from the month of December and begins with an increase of 
      205kwh but each time it is decreasing as the months pass
      remaining at 185 kwh
  </p>
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <p >
      It can be evidenced 2 colors, the gray has to do with the linear regression
      that is in decline and in La Roja has to do with the true consumption according
      to the month, in this it can be observed that the decline is still seen although 
      in the month of January increased 5kwh
    </p>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
    syntax in order to compute that.
    $$Y= -6.10(6)+212.10=175.5$$
  </li>

  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or
    remain stable the consumption of electric energy.
  </li>
  <p>
      In conclusion I can observe that in the graph there is an inversely 
      proportional correlation, that is, as the variable x increases, the
      variable decreases and, in the month of December it can be seen that 
      it starts from 200kwh</p>
</ul>
<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis1Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis1Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <p>
      I can observe that in this graph the linear regression is
      increasing and you start from 3 residents per household to 7 residents
  </p>
  
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <p>
      What can be evidenced in the two colors is that in the regression line
     that is gray you can see an increase from 100kwh to 700 kWhy in the true 
     consumption are the red points that are not according to the regression line
  </p>
    <li>
      Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where
      $200$ people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
    </li>
    $$Y=116.95(200)+(-254.24)= 23.135$$
    <li>
      A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
      between these two variables.
    </li>
    <p>
        In conclusion, a coefficient of slope 0 is shown in Figure 2 on the grey line,
       showing an increasing trend, the variable x is decreasing and the variable and 
       increasing in the real consumption of residents can be evidenced that those living 
       with 3 and 4 people spend similarly from 100 to a little more than 200, in the case 
       of the one living with 7 people spends a little more than 700 kwh, is to say that there
        is no clear pattern
    </p>
  </p>
</ul>
