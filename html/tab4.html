    <h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
    <p>This second part of the project must be done individual.
      For each plot, you must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your information is true.
    </p>
    <div id="analysis3Plot1"></div>
    <p id="analysis3Eqn1" style="text-align: center"></p>
    <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
    <p>According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic displays that behavior in terms of:
      </p>
      <ul>
            <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
            <p>
                with respect to the graph of months and amount of energy consumed,
                we can consider that the regression maintains a balance and constancy,
                in which it is evident that in the last 5 months the amount of KWH varies,
                 sometimes reaching 185 and other times in an amount lower than this.

            </p>
            <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
            <p>
            -According to the color ratio we can show that the red dots represent
            the amount of light consumed according to the month , although the dots 
            look a little scattered among themselves ,are close to the line that represents
            us regression
            </p>
            <li>Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.</li>
            $$ y=0.00(6)+176.80     y=176.8$$
            <p>
              R=The energy consumpiton in the next month will be 176.8 Kwhs
            <li>A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or remain stable the consumption of electric energy.</li>
            <p>
                In conclusion we can consider that the gray dots are aligned with the straight ,however as
                for the red dots these are scattered throughout the graph , in there is no pattern In month
                one the energy consumption is 185 KHW and in month 5 about 165 to 180,so the points are 
                completely dispersed, because depending on the month varies the amount of energy consumed
            </p>
      </ul>
    <h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
    <div id="analysis3Plot2"></div>
    <p id="eanalysis3Eqn2" style="text-align: center"></p>
    <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
    <p>According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic displays that behavior in terms of:
    </p>
    <ul>
         <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
         <p>
         -With respect to the graph of residents and energy consumption, we can consider
            that the regression maintains a constant increase, since we can observe the energy 
            expenditure with respect to each of the residents and the consumption they generate, 
            i.e.,the greater the number of inhabitants, the higher the consumption rate.
         </p>
         <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
         <p>
        - With regard to the relationship between colours, we can see that the grey dots 
         form the line, in this case the regression that is increasing ,but as for the location
         and the result of consumption is represented by the red colour, depending on the residents,
         the total amount of energy is shown together
         </p>
         <li>Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$ people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.</li>
         <p>
        $$ y=108.85(200)+(-203.37)  y=21566.63 $$

         </p>  energy consumption in a residence where 200 people live is 21566.63kwhs
         </p>
         <li>A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation between these two variables.</li>
         <p>
           - According to the variables and their relationship we can deduce what depending
            on the number of residents will increase or decrease energy consumption ,since
            when there are more people in a household increase electronic appliances and energy
            use
         </p>
      </ul>
